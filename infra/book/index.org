#+TITLE NOS Jenkins-X (Labs) CI/CD underlying infrastucture

  As part of our Jenkins-X pipeline deployment, we need to automate the underlying
  infrastructure deployment when needed.

  This repository aims to describe and maintains tha underlying
  infrastructure.  At this stage, it targets only gcloud. Resources
  are described in typescript and maintained by pulumi. The resources
  are grouped in multiple services as follow :

  - [[file:~/Coding/nxmatic/jxlabs-nos-infra/control-plane][control-plane]] and it's default node pool
  - [[file:~/Coding/nxmatic/jxlabs-nos-infra/builder-node-pool][builder node]] pool
  - [[file:~/Coding/nxmatic/jxlabs-nos-infra/helmboot][helmboot]]
  - [[file:~/Coding/nxmatic/jxlabs-nos-infra/kaniko][kaniko]]
  - [[file:~/Coding/nxmatic/jxlabs-nos-infra/dns-zone][dns zone]]
  - [[file:~/Coding/nxmatic/jxlabs-nos-infra/long-term-storage][long term storage]]
  - [[file:~/Coding/nxmatic/jxlabs-nos-infra/keyring][keyring]] and the [[file:~/Coding/nxmatic/jxlabs-nos-infra/vault][vault]]

  Pulumi loads the typescript objects graph from our defined modules, compare them
  with it's stack content and compute an update plan according to.

* usage
  At this stage, we're invoking pulumi by hand with the help of make using the pulumi provider backend. That's 
  mean you should login into the [[https://app.pulumi.com][pulumi app ]]before invoking the make targets.

  The make target pattern is ~[all|k8s|keyring|other]/[init|select|refresh|diff|update|destroy|rm]@name~.
  So, for deploying a new stack, here is the command needed:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ pulumi login
  $ make all/install
  $ make all/init@nxmatic
  $ make all/update@nxmatic
#+END_EXAMPLE
